# Prativarta-Pathya
 We aspire to connect villagers amongst themselves as well as provide them with tools and benefits to live a good life. For far too long villages have been disconnected from one another, ignored by the ministers in charge of their districts and manipulated by private organisations. The goal is to enable various villages to communicate their issues with each other.      With this web-app we aim to make villagers as self sufficient as possible while remaining interconnected and helping them adjust to the current Covid situation and being safe and sound by providing necessary precautions that helps them in protecting themselves.
